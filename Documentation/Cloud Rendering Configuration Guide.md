# Cloud rendering configuration guide

This guide explains all the parameters used to control the appearance, quality, and performance of the cloud rendering system.

> For a successful setup, itâ€™s recommended to duplicate a sample `CloudSettings` asset from the example folder and customize from there.

---
## Scene Setup

### Far plane
Make sure the **Camera Far Plane** is set to a large enough distance so that clouds and fog render correctly.

---
### Transmittance Map
Add a ``Transmittance Map`` component to a GameObject in your scene and configure it as needed.  

This component stores volumetric lighting information in a 3D texture. It can be used to significantly reduce lighting computations, or even fully eliminate them by baking the lighting once.

| Parameter                         | Description                                                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ``Refresh All``                   | Re-creates the 3D texture. Needed when changing texture size                                                                                           |
| ``Calculate Lighting Each Frame`` | Enables real-time computing of 3D lighting. Useful for editing, can be slow if used with big texture sizes and costly lighting settings                |
| ``Map Compute``                   | Reference to the compute shader calculating the lighting                                                                                               |
| ``Clouds``                        | Reference to the ``CloudsPostProcess`` asset                                                                                                           |
| ``Light Min Step Size``           | Minimum step size of the light rays during ray-marching. Lower values lead to better visuals but can slow down the application if computed each frame. |
| ``Texture Width``                 | 3D Texture Width                                                                                                                                       |
| ``Texture Height``                | 3D Texture Height                                                                                                                                      |
| ``Texture Depth``                 | 3D Texture Depth                                                                                                                                       |
> It is necessary to refresh the map after changing settings in the clouds preset.
---
### Clouds Post Process
Add a ``Clouds Post Process`` component to an object in your scene and configure it properly. 

This component is used to render the clouds onto a buffer.

| Parameter             | Description                                          |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ``Active``            | Toggles rendering of the clouds                      |
| ``Refresh``           | Re-creates the rendering buffers (debug only)        |
| ``Cloud Settings``    | Reference to a ``CloudSettings`` preset              |
| `Sun`                 | The directional light used for lighting calculations |
| ``Transmittance Map`` | A transmittance map script, used to compute lighting |

---
### Post Process Stack
Attach a ``Post Process Stack`` component to the camera, and make it reference the ``Clouds Post Process component`` previously created in the ``Processings`` list.

This component takes a list of post-processing steps and applies them sequentially to the final rendered image.

---
## Creating a Cloud Settings Asset

To create a new settings asset:

> **Menu**: `Assets > Create > Rendering > CloudSettings`

> When editing the cloud settings, it is recommended to temporarily turn on `Calculate Lighting Each Frame` from the ``Transmittance Map`` in order to preview the lighting changes in real time.
---
### Shaders and Compute
This section only references the shaders and material used by the system. The material must use the Cloud Shader provided by the package.

| Parameter                 | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Cloud Shader`            | Should point to the fragment shader used during clouds post processing.                                      |
| ``Cloud Compute Shader``  | Should point to the compute shader responsible for computing transmittance and lighting values of each pixel |
| ``Post Process Material`` | Should point to a material using the Cloud Shader referenced previously                                      |

---
### Containers
Clouds and fog are rendered inside a bounding box defined by the following:

| Parameter         | Description                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `Clouds Position` | World position of the cloud container. |
| `Clouds Scale`    | World size of the cloud container.     |
| `Fog Position`    | World position of the fog container.   |
| ``Fog Scale``     | World size of the fog container.       |

**Important**: Clouds are only rendered inside the fog volume, so make sure the fog container is larger than the clouds container.

---
### Shape
A **Signed Distance Field (SDF)** stored in a 3D texture defines the shape of the cloudscape. It allows efficient raymarching and detail shaping.

| Parameter           | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ``SDF Texture``     | A reference to the SDF texture defining the cloudscape                             |
| `SDF Texture Scale` | Defines the scale of one repetition of the 3D texture in world space.              |
| `Global Density`    | Controls the base density of the cloud volume. Affects lighting and visual detail. |

### Ambient Occlusion
Ambient occlusion darkens regions where light is less likely to reach due to surrounding particles.

| Parameter      | Description                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ``Use AO``     | Toggles ambient occlusion                                                                                                   |
| `AO_Offset`    | Distance used to sample neighboring positions for AO. Higher values highlight large shapes. Lower values show fine details. |
| `AO_Intensity` | Multiplier for AO contribution. Higher values create darker, more defined shapes.                                           |

### Quality Settings

| Parameter             | Description                                                                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Render Scale`        | Resolution scale of the cloud rendering pass. Lower values improve performance but may cause aliasing.           |
| `Render Distance`     | Maximum horizontal distance at which clouds are rendered. Use a high value for proper fog accumulation.          |
| `Cloud Max Steps`     | Maximum number of steps per ray. Lowering this can improve performance but may cause incomplete cloud rendering. |
| `Cloud Min Step Size` | Minimum raymarching step size. Larger values increase speed but reduce detail.                                   |
| `Fog Step Size`       | Raymarching step size for fog. Can be higher than cloud step size since fog has lower frequency detail.          |

Aliasing caused by different render scales:

![Render scale](Images/Render%20scale.png) 

---
### Noise Settings

Raymarching uses 2D noise to offset ray start distances. This helps reduce aliasing caused by discrete ray steps and blends shapes visually.

| Parameter                | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Offset Noise Intensity` | Intensity of the offset applied to ray origins. Higher values reduce aliasing but introduce screen-space noise. |

Without vs. with noise offset:
